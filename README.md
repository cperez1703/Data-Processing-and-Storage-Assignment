Official Assignment Modifications:
The assignment can be improved by providing more clarity with the return values of the get function. Originally the assignment was created in C++ however, there wasn't any way to return a null value with a int function. Another modification would be adding more documentation regarding the functionality with the user, such as "Create a main function that would accept command line arguments".
